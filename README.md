# Vehicle parking Management System.
This is a sample application for a vechicle parking management system.
There is a parking lot, where vechicle can enter from 2 entry gates, and can exit from 2 exit gates.
The total capacity of the lot is 100 cars.
When a vechicle enters the premise, system will capture its registration Number, and will issue a ticket.
Upon existing, the ticket is to be proceduced at the exit gate.
System will calculate the parked time, and will show payable amount.
At any given time, the system should be capable of handleing -
* for any vehicle number, we should be able to get the current charge for the parking at any given point of time. 
* get the list of vehicles parked with time since parked 
* check if slots are available for parking
